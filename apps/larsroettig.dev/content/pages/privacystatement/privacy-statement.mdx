# DATA PRIVACY STATEMENT

### RESPONSIBLE PARTY FOR DATA PROCESSING ON THIS WEBSITE&nbsp;

Lars Röttig&nbsp;<br />
Am Gries 37&nbsp;<br />
83026 Rosenheim&nbsp;

### PRIVACY PROTECTION

The use of my website is normally possible without providing any
personal data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or email
addresses) are collected on my pages, this is always done on a
voluntary basis, as far as possible.&nbsp; These data will not be
passed on to third parties without your explicit consent.I point out
that data transmission in the Internet (e.g. in case of
communication via e-mail) may have security flaws. A complete
protection of data against the access by third parties is not
possible.

The use of contact data published within the scope of the obligation
to provide legal details by third parties for sending advertising
and information material not expressly requested is herewith
expressly contradicted. The operators of this website expressly
reserve the right to take legal steps in case unsolicited
advertising , e.g. spam mails, are sent.

### SSL- AND/OR TLS ENCRYPTION

For safety reasons and in order to protect the transmission of
confidential information you send to us as site operators, my
website uses a SSL and/or TLS encryption. You may recognize the
encrypted connection by the “https://“ URL and the lock icon in the
address line.

### SERVER LOG FILES

The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores
information in so-called server log files which your browser
transmits automatically to us. These are:&nbsp;

- Browser type/ browser version
- Operating system used (User agent parameters of the browser)
- Referrer URL
- Requested URL
- Data size of the server response
- IP address of the accessing computer
- Time of the server request

These data cannot be attributed directly to certain persons. A
combination of these data with other data sources is not done. We
reserve the right to check these data subsequently if we become
aware of specific indications for illegal usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

### COOKIES

Our web pages partly use so-called cookies. These cookies do not damage your computer in any way and they do not contain any viruses. Cookies are used for making our offer more user-friendly, more effective and more secure. Cookies are small text files which are placed on your computer and stored by your browser. Most of the cookies used by us are so-called “session cookies”. They are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Other cookies remain stored on your terminal device until you delete them. These cookies enable us to recognize your browser when you visit us again. You may set your browser in such a way that you will be informed on the placing of cookies and permit cookies only in the individual case, i.e. exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or exclude them generally and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when the browser is closed. In case cookies are deactivated certain functions of this website may be limited.

### OTHER THIRD-PARTY COOKIES

We use Youtube technologies and thus include videos in order to provide an extended range of services and offer a more attractive design. You can find more information on the cookies used in the relevant section on video portals. The legal basis for storing these cookies is given in Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO (General Data Protection Regulation).

### SHARE BUTTONS

On the homepage I provide static share buttons to Facebook and Twitter. These are no plug-ins of Facebook or Twitter and the integration does not lead to the transmission of data to Facebook or Twitter. If you click the relevant button you get directly to the relevant social media portal and you can post the included link there if you log into your account. Further information can be found in the privacy note of Facebook at
http://de-de.facebook.com/policy.php
or Twitter at

You may change your privacy settings in the account settings at

### RIGHT OF COMPLAINT AT THE COMPETENT SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY

I are constantly trying to fulfil all data protection provisions and we take your concern very seriously and gladly take care of it. Alternatively, in case of data protection questions, you as the aggrieved party have the right of complaint at the competent supervisory authority. The competent supervisory authority with regard to data protection issues is the Commissioner for Data Protection of the federal state where your company has its registered office.
